            <h2>Minecraft</h2>
            <p>
                I started playing Minecraft in 2014, on Pocket Edition in Creative Mode. The first thing I ever built
                was a castle out of stone bricks. A few weeks later, I followed a tutorial on WikiHow for survival
                mode. At first I didn't understand the concept, but after a few days I created a new world and survival
                quickly became my favourite way to play. After watching lots of videos on YouTube, I built a house, a
                storage room and became excited when the 0.9 update came out.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't long after this that I bought the PC version of Minecraft. It was then in version 1.7.10, and
                I again started on creative mode. I was amazed by redstone, something that wasn't on PE at the time.
                The first survival world I played on a lot was in a snow biome, near a river. My storage room used item
                frames, something that didn't come to Pocket Edition until 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the moment I am playing Sky Factory 4, which I started only a few days after it was released. Before,
                I've played through the early-game in SevTech Ages, Foolcraft and FTB Revelations
