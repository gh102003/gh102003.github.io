            <h2>Cities: Skylines</h2>
            <p>
                I currently play this game quite a bit and I own the After Dark, Mass Transit and Snowfall expansions. 
                I bought the last two when they have been in a sale because they are normally quite expensive (around 
                Â£10 each), which quickly adds up.
            </p>
            <a class="block-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/">Cities: Skylines on Steam</a>
            <p>
                I've played both with and without mods. Although there are times when I prefer vanilla for its simplicity 
                and performance benefits, I usually play with mods for more customisation and less monotony. There
                is also the excellent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1619685021">Move It!</a> 
                mod, which lets you fix errors even after you build things.
            </p>

            <p>
                I like to build cities with efficient road networks and realistic public tranportation systems. I've found
                some more exciting roads on the Steam Workshop, with different tram track and bike lane arrangements.
                In the future I would like to experiment with height, creating more bridges and elevated areas. At
                some point I would like to design a metro-style transit map of my city, with all my lines in different
                colours and shapes.
            </p>

            <p>
                I used to find traffic management a big issue in my cities, especially when I first started playing. But 
                now, with the help of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=583429740">Traffic Manager: President Edition</a>
                mod, I have learnt how to manage the vehicles in my city much more effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Six traffic management tips:
                <ul>
                    <li>Use roundabouts at major city junctions, as well as for highway connections</li>
                    <li>Build effective public transport links including bus routes and metro lines</li>
                    <li>Cycle and pedestrian paths can drastically reduce the number of cars on the road</li>
                    <li>Try to create a main arterial road or two through each neighbourhood</li>
                    <li>Space out junctions, especially on larger roads &mdash; leave at least 20 units between them</li>
                    <li>Avoid crossroads and stick to T-junctions instead</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of my favourite mods:
