            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>I know multiple programming languages, although I'm not very experienced with using all of them.</p>

            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>I'm most familiar with using Java because this is what Minecraft was made in. When I began building
                desktop applications, Java was a natural starting point because I had already used it when I was
                experimenting with Forge mods.</p>
            <p>
                I'd like to experiment more with the streams API in Java, and also get into the JavaFX
                library.
                I've already played with various JSON libraries, including <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/">json.simple</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">GSON</a>.
            </p>
            <p>My <a href="currency_converter.html">Currency Converter</a> was first application I
                ever made with Swing. I used it as an opportunity to learn about saving files, serialising JSON and
                using libraries.</p>

            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>I think that Python is a great language for small data projects. I've used it for creating simple neural
                networks as well as making games like <a href="/programming/breakout.html">Breakout</a>. I started
                using it on a Raspberry Pi, where it was the recommended language for using the GPIO pins.</p>
            <p>The list comprehension and slice syntax is very intuitive in Python, so I have recently been
                experimenting with them.</p>

            <h3>C#</h3>
            <p>I've experimented with C# for Universal Windows Platform apps (like <a href="/programming/phototweak.html">PhotoTweak</a>),
                and for Unity scripts. I'm not very experienced with it, although I plan to look into developing games
                and native win32 applications with it.</p>

            <h3>Javascript</h3>
            <p>I used node.js for the server side of my <a href="/programming/noughts_and_crosses.html">Noughts
                    and Crosses game</a> and jQuery for the client side. jQuery's selectors and AJAX shortcuts made my
                project much more streamlined.</p>
                <p>More recently, I've looked into p5.js and make some <a href="/programming/p5js_projects.html">small projects</a> using it.</p>
