            <h2>p5.js Projects</h2>
            <p>
                After finding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train</a> 
                on YouTube and watching a lot of his videos, I decided to have a go with p5.js I started off by 
                taking lots of inspiration from him, but later made some more original projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                p5.js is a great tool for programmers, especially beginners, to try out different things in an 
                easy-to-use environment. It is very simple to set up, and makes even complicated things much 
                simpler. You can use p5 for many different things, including games, visualisations and infographics.
                It's great to test out new programming concepts, like recursion and OOP.
            </p>

            <p>
                Functions like <code>lerp</code> and classes like <code>Vector</code> and <code>color</code> make 
                everyday tasks simple, since you don't need to type out mundane code to do something you've done 
                before. p5's event loop and input management allow for rapid improvement without questioning when 
                things are happening.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being based in Javascript makes p5.js an ideal way to share ideas on the web. No specialist software
                needs to be installed to view projects, and even phones and tablets can run your code. However, 
                Javascript does tend to slow down on some devices due to the nature of interpreted languages.
            </p>

            <p>Here's a list of these projects, with links to try them out. Please note that these links may be slightly out of date, so for the latest versions download them directly from my GitHub repository, linked at the bottom.

                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Later on, I'd like to make a 3D game or visualisation in p5.js, and experiment with matrix
                transformations. Maybe I could look at other libraries, perhaps for data processing or image
                recognition. Some of the animations in my fairy lights game were fun to make, especially the
                arrow on the pink light, so I could think about other satisfying transitions.
