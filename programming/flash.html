            <h2>Flash</h2>

            <p>
                <a href="https://flashapp.uk.to">Flash</a> is a simple flashcards web app. It's now live 
                in production, running from my Raspberry Pi. The frontend is running on a Nginx server and
                the backend is routed through a reverse proxy to a Node.js server managed by pm2.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img class="image-res-change" src="/res/img/flash/screenshotLowRes.png" style="background-image: url(/res/img/flash/screenshotLowRes.png)" alt="Flash screenshot">
                <figcaption>A sample category of flashcards, including subcategories</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Flash has been an insight for me into <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React.js</a>. It also 
                uses <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/">React Router</a> and a few other 
                smaller libraries to build a user experience that flows well with fluid CSS animations.</p>
            <p>
                Features:
                <ul>
                    <li>Categories &mdash; can be dragged into other categories</li>
                    <li>Colour coding &mdash; categories can be coloured, either from the palette or a hex code</li>
                    <li>Full screen mode &mdash; to view a flashcard isolated from the rest</li>
                    <li>Quizzes &mdash; to test your knowledge</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                To add a new category, you can hover over the add button and click on the text that appears. A menu
                will open (with a nice CSS animation!) where you can enter a name and select a colour. There is an
                arrangement of colours to pick, or a custom hex code can be typed in.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 'breadcrumb' above the cards shows which category you are viewing, as well as a list of its
                parents. This aids with navigation, like a map of where you currently are. By clicking a part of 
                the breadcrumb, you can move to a different page, or a category or card can be dropped into it 
                to move it.
            </p>

            <p>
                The authentication system was a challenge to create because I had never done anything like it
                before. I read into <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> and also had to create an
                HTTPS certificate with <a href="https://certbot.eff.org">CertBot</a>. This allows each user to
                have their own area for flashcards that can't be disrupted by anybody else. Despite this, I
                still haven't gotten round to integrating this with my tags system, so at the moment the same
                set of tags are common to all users. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Later on, I will add a dark theme and I will optimise the loading of categories. I may decide
                to add an authentication system, so only users with permission can edit the cards; this would
                make Flash more suitable for real-world use. I also need to look into replacing my drag-n-drop
                library with a mobile-first solution to make my web app accessible to everyone.
